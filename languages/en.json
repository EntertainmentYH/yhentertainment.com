    "web-history-text": "As mentioned above, this website was created on March 30, 2025, but it is not the first website of Entertainment_YH! The author first learned HTML in 2024, when they needed to prepare for the high school entrance exam, so there wasn't much learning in the early stages of the website. As of now (March 31th, 2025), the author is currently in the first year of high school, so updates may be slow, but the author promises that over time, the website's content will become more and more abundant. (Of course, if you want to see the original website, it is currently lying in the previous project, and it may be publicly displayed in the future (as a negative teaching material), but for now, it is considered a draft because the author has constantly attempted new codes and features without seriously learning the foundational basic code, resulting in a website that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor free of bugs, which is why this version exists.)",

For example, resetting a relationship with someone so that after the reset, you are like strangers; or resetting a broken glass so that it goes back to the timeline before it was broken. What would you do with this remote control? (It can only be used to reset once and then it becomes invalid.)",

    "article001-title": "In My Eyes, “Mental Illness”: Labels, Relativity, and the Truth of Loneliness",
    "article001-description": "The viewpoint is proposed by the author, and the text is organized by ChatGPT.",
    "article001-paragraph-1": "We often talk about “mental patients,” but do we really understand them? I’ve thought about this: is their problem truly a fault in their minds? To me, perhaps they simply possess a theoretical system fundamentally different from that of the majority.",
    "article001-paragraph-2": "They might say, “1 + 1 = 3.” To us, that sounds absurd—but they aren’t necessarily wrong. They use a unique logic and perspective to explain the world. In their framework, this expression may be reasonable—it just doesn’t align with the conventional coordinate system we use.",
    "article001-paragraph-3": "Mainstream society says a person should get up, eat, study, and sleep. But these “shoulds” are simply socially agreed-upon rules, a kind of artificial order defined as absolutely correct. Meanwhile, these individuals may deliberately carve out time from such routines to immerse themselves in their own worldview, developing a kind of logic that we simply don’t understand.",
    "article001-paragraph-4": "We label such people as “mentally ill.” This label seems neutral, but in fact, it’s a form of forced classification. It defines the boundary of “normal” and cuts off the possibility of true understanding.",
    "article001-paragraph-5": "I’ve always been sensitive to labels. They’re like sticky notes society casually slaps on people—“excellent,” “problematic,” “socially awkward,” “weirdo.” Over time, people begin to live according to the label, rather than their real selves. Yet reality is not black and white, and a label never captures a person’s essence.",
    "article001-paragraph-6": "Because of this, I’ve also come up with a belief: there is no absolute right or wrong in the world—only relative right and wrong. “1 + 1 = 2” is correct under decimal arithmetic and axioms of math. But if the system changes, what’s considered “correct” changes too.",
    "article001-paragraph-7": "Those we call “mentally ill” may simply be living in a different system. They may be isolated, excluded, and eventually fall into deep self-doubt. Some of them choose to assimilate—to suppress their original theoretical systems and conform to the mainstream, just to feel a little less lonely.",
    "article001-paragraph-8": "This kind of assimilation saddens me deeply. Because it’s not understanding, not acceptance—it’s suppression and compromise.",
    "article001-paragraph-9": "And honestly, I myself often struggle in this way. I crave expression and understanding, but most of the time, it feels like playing the lute to a cow. I don’t want to be labeled, and I don’t want people to avoid me just because I think differently.",
    "article001-paragraph-10": "I want to say: maybe we don’t need everyone to think alike. Maybe we don’t need to measure people using a single standard. Perhaps real “normalcy” is not about conformity—but about finding connection through our differences.",
    "article002-title": "The Multi-Layered Pollution of the Internet: The Path to Collective Psychological Collapse",
    "article002-description": "The viewpoint is proposed by the author, and the text is organized by ChatGPT.",
    "article002-citation-1": "In the age of information explosion, the internet was supposed to be a channel for connecting the world, inspiring thought, and carrying human wisdom. Yet in recent years, we have witnessed its distortion: it is no longer merely a technical space, but a black hole of emotions, a purgatory of values, and a graveyard of trust. This did not happen by chance, but through a gradual and clear process—a long-term struggle between human nature, psychology, society, and technology.",
    "article002-citation-2": "This article attempts to trace how the online environment has twisted step by step since 2019, from a \"golden year\" to a digital wasteland, from a square of consensus to a gathering ground of extreme isolation. By following this timeline, we can not only see how the internet has deteriorated but also understand the changes and struggles within humanity.",
    "article002-subtitle-1": "I. From Virus to Viral Emotions (2020)",
    "article002-paragraph-1-1": "In January 2020, COVID-19 first broke out in Wuhan, China, and quickly swept across the globe. Human society was forced to hit pause: lockdowns, working from home, and closed borders became the norm.",
    "article002-paragraph-1-2": "Disconnected from the real world, people turned to the internet for replacement. Short video platforms, microblogs, and messaging apps suddenly became the main battlefield for emotional release. Initially, there was mutual support and encouragement, but soon anxiety, dissatisfaction, panic, and mistrust spread rapidly. The internet was no longer just a tool—it became a psychological refuge, but also a source of emotional contagion.",
    "article002-subtitle-2": "II. Shadows Accumulate: Emotional Venting Becomes the Norm (2021)",
    "article002-paragraph-2-1": "In 2021, the pandemic lingered, and the sense of hopelessness deepened. More and more people expressed their repression, anger, and loneliness online.",
    "article002-paragraph-2-2": "On Douban, depression groups were shut down due to overly negative content; Zhihu was flooded with questions about anxiety, escapism, giving up, and academic burnout. \"Emo culture\" became a trend on short video platforms. Algorithms, designed to maximize engagement, amplified these posts, causing negative emotions to spread like a virus.",
    "article002-paragraph-2-3": "The internet began to resemble a massive emotional landfill. With no one to clean it up—and no one capable of doing so—people gradually adapted to, and even relied on, this toxic atmosphere.",
    "article002-subtitle-3": "III. The Rise of Abstraction: Expression No Longer Aims for Understanding (2022)",
    "article002-paragraph-3-1": "In 2022, various forms of \"abstract expression\" flooded the web.",
    "article002-paragraph-3-2": "Low-resolution, meaningless looping videos and illogical edits became popular on Bilibili and Douyin. Meme culture centered on \"AI parodies\" and surreal comics spread across forums. Expression became increasingly emotional and vague, no longer seeking clarity or logic.",
    "article002-paragraph-3-3": "For instance, \"crazy literature\" became trendy—posts that abandon grammatical or logical structure, preserving only symbols of pain or absurdity. Teenagers began using phrases like \"I'm losing my mind\" and \"Humanity doesn’t deserve the internet\" to express exhaustion.",
    "article002-paragraph-3-4": "Abstraction became a way to escape reality and emotional suppression—but it also blurred communication boundaries between people.",
    "article002-subtitle-4": "IV. Signs of Psychological Collapse: Extremist Thought vs. Real-World Turmoil (2023)",
    "article002-paragraph-4-1": "By 2023, extreme ideologies were accelerating globally.",
    "article002-paragraph-4-2": "On one side, the prolonged war in Ukraine and frequent Middle East conflicts made the internet a breeding ground for wartime propaganda and conspiracy theories. On the other, young people around the world, worn down by years of repression, began distrusting institutions, society, and even humanity itself.",
    "article002-paragraph-4-3": "Terms like \"anti-humanity,\" \"destructionism,\" and \"pure evil\" trended on social platforms. Bilibili’s \"Deconstructing Society\" series gained popularity, and on Weibo, discussions about AI destroying the world shifted from science fiction to genuine concern.",
    "article002-paragraph-4-4": "Extreme views were no longer niche—they were algorithmically amplified, pulling more people into cognitive echo chambers.",
    "article002-subtitle-5": "V. Collapse of Trust: The Breakdown of Interpersonal Structure (2024)",
    "article002-paragraph-5-1": "In 2024, AI-generated content surged, and distinguishing truth from falsehood became a major issue online.",
    "article002-paragraph-5-2": "Photoshopped images, fake videos, and pseudo-original articles flooded social platforms. During major news events, information often became untraceable. Users grew used to doubting everything: “Is this real?” “Was this staged?” “Is this just for clout?” became the most common comments.",
    "article002-paragraph-5-3": "At the same time, sarcasm, irony, and nihilism became the dominant tone. Sincere, serious, or thoughtful content gradually lost visibility. The internet, once a tool for connection, morphed into an emotional roller coaster—you never knew whether the next encounter would be kind or hostile.",
    "article002-subtitle-6": "VI. 2025: The Rise of Grotesque, Vulgar, and Destructive Content",
    "article002-paragraph-6-1": "In early 2025, international studies on the negative effects of online content on minors gained attention.",
    "article002-paragraph-6-2": "Teenagers were found to be addicted to videos containing violence, sexual suggestions, and grotesque humor—often under the guise of \"jokes,\" \"memes,\" or \"challenges.\" These videos instilled distorted values, and some even encouraged dangerous behavior.",
    "article002-paragraph-6-3": "The internet became a \"content alchemy furnace\": whatever draws clicks gets produced—at any cost.",
    "article002-paragraph-6-4": "Adults may still be able to distinguish right from wrong, but the young gradually form a worldview where human nature is twisted and malice comes without consequence.",
    "article002-subtitle-7": "VII. The Release of Human Nature: Instinct vs. Order",
    "article002-paragraph-7-1": "When malice can be expressed without cost, and emotions can be spread irresponsibly, the internet becomes a magnifying glass for human instincts.",
    "article002-paragraph-7-2": "\"I’m not evil—I’m just anonymous.\" \"Don’t take it seriously—it’s just the internet.\" \"Anyone who cares loses.\" These phrases became the internet’s theme song. Humanity didn’t become worse—it just lost the leash of social norms.",
    "article002-paragraph-7-3": "Just as you wouldn’t spit on the ground in public, but may hurl abuse online, technology has unleashed the parts of human nature we’d rather not confront. What we face is not just technology, but ourselves.",
    "article002-subtitle-8": "VIII. A Digital Imbalance Model: From 0 to 10,000",
    "article002-paragraph-8-1": "Let’s imagine a stable civilization as a score of 0.",
    "article002-paragraph-8-2": "When pollution is only 1, 2, or 3, we can counter it with education, public discourse, and law. But now, online pollution has grown exponentially: verbal abuse, algorithmic manipulation, fake information, emotional control.",
    "article002-paragraph-8-3": "To \"subtract these pollutants\" is no longer something a few individuals can accomplish. But \"collective action\" is exactly what we now lack—because we’ve lost our sense of \"collective.\"",
    "article002-subtitle-9": "VIIII. Conclusion: Can We Still Subtract That 10,000?",
    "article002-paragraph-9-1": "This is not destiny—but it is a warning.",
    "article002-paragraph-9-2": "In 2025, we stand at a crossroads: wake up or fall deeper. The internet was once a source of enlightenment and connection. Now it is slowly becoming a seducer and corrupter.",
    "article002-paragraph-9-3": "Do you still dare to be \"sincere\"? Do you still dare to \"trust\"? Are you willing to be that -1 in a world of +1s?",
    "article002-paragraph-9-4": "If so, then start today. Use truth, kindness, patience, and logic—in every post, every share—to restore the internet’s sense of value.",
