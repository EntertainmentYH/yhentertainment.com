I hope it can become an interesting place to record the bits and pieces of my life and to let more people know about my basic information. At the same time, I welcome feedback from everyone at any time, and I will keep updating the website content to make it better and better. Everyone is welcome to visit!",
    "web-history": "Website History",
    "web-history-text": "As mentioned above, this website was created on March 30, 2025, but it is not the first website of Entertainment_YH! The author first learned HTML in 2024, when they needed to prepare for the high school entrance exam, so there wasn't much learning in the early stages of the website. As of now (March 31th, 2025), the author is currently in the first year of high school, so updates may be slow, but the author promises that over time, the website's content will become more and more abundant. (Of course, if you want to see the original website, it is currently lying in the previous project, and it may be publicly displayed in the future (as a negative teaching material), but for now, it is considered a draft because the author has constantly attempted new codes and features without seriously learning the foundational basic code, resulting in a website that is neither aesthetically pleasing nor free of bugs, which is why this version exists.)",

For example, resetting a relationship with someone so that after the reset, you are like strangers; or resetting a broken glass so that it goes back to the timeline before it was broken. What would you do with this remote control? (It can only be used to reset once and then it becomes invalid.)",

    "article001-description": "The viewpoint is proposed by the author, and the text is organized by ChatGPT.",
    "article001-paragraph-1": "We often talk about “mental patients,” but do we really understand them? I’ve thought about this: is their problem truly a fault in their minds? To me, perhaps they simply possess a theoretical system fundamentally different from that of the majority.",
    "article001-paragraph-2": "They might say, “1 + 1 = 3.” To us, that sounds absurd—but they aren’t necessarily wrong. They use a unique logic and perspective to explain the world. In their framework, this expression may be reasonable—it just doesn’t align with the conventional coordinate system we use.",
    "article001-paragraph-3": "Mainstream society says a person should get up, eat, study, and sleep. But these “shoulds” are simply socially agreed-upon rules, a kind of artificial order defined as absolutely correct. Meanwhile, these individuals may deliberately carve out time from such routines to immerse themselves in their own worldview, developing a kind of logic that we simply don’t understand.",
    "article001-paragraph-4": "We label such people as “mentally ill.” This label seems neutral, but in fact, it’s a form of forced classification. It defines the boundary of “normal” and cuts off the possibility of true understanding.",
    "article001-paragraph-5": "I’ve always been sensitive to labels. They’re like sticky notes society casually slaps on people—“excellent,” “problematic,” “socially awkward,” “weirdo.” Over time, people begin to live according to the label, rather than their real selves. Yet reality is not black and white, and a label never captures a person’s essence.",
    "article001-paragraph-6": "Because of this, I’ve also come up with a belief: there is no absolute right or wrong in the world—only relative right and wrong. “1 + 1 = 2” is correct under decimal arithmetic and axioms of math. But if the system changes, what’s considered “correct” changes too.",
    "article001-paragraph-7": "Those we call “mentally ill” may simply be living in a different system. They may be isolated, excluded, and eventually fall into deep self-doubt. Some of them choose to assimilate—to suppress their original theoretical systems and conform to the mainstream, just to feel a little less lonely.",
    "article001-paragraph-8": "This kind of assimilation saddens me deeply. Because it’s not understanding, not acceptance—it’s suppression and compromise.",
    "article001-paragraph-9": "And honestly, I myself often struggle in this way. I crave expression and understanding, but most of the time, it feels like playing the lute to a cow. I don’t want to be labeled, and I don’t want people to avoid me just because I think differently.",
    "article001-paragraph-10": "I want to say: maybe we don’t need everyone to think alike. Maybe we don’t need to measure people using a single standard. Perhaps real “normalcy” is not about conformity—but about finding connection through our differences.",
